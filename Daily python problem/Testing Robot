'''
Chef has bought a new robot, which will be used for delivering dishes to his customers. He started testing 
the robot by letting it move on a line.
Initially, the robot is placed at the coordinate 
x=X. Then, it should execute a sequence of 
N commands, described by a string 
S with length 
N. Each character of this string is either 'L' or 'R', denoting that the robot should walk one step to the left
(decreasing x by 1 ) or to the right (increasing x by 1), respectively.
How many distinct points are visited by the robot when it has executed all the commands? A point 
p is visited by the robot if p is an integer and the robot's position before or after executing some command is x=p.

# cook your dish here

def robot(n,x):
    string = list(input())
    new = [x]
    for i in string:
        if i == "R":
            new.append(new[-1] + 1)
        else:
            new.append(new[-1] - 1)
            
    return (len(set(new)))
   
m=int(input())
for i in range(m):
    n,x=map(int,input().split())
    print(robot(n,x))
    
    '''
    Firstly, we created a list with the initial position and then started a
    for loop to iterate over the list containing the characters of the string. If robot moves 
    'right' we increase the most recent position of the robot by 1 else it decreases by 1.
    '''

Then we measure the length of the "new" list by converting it to a set (as converting in a set removes duplicated elements).

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n,x = map(int,input().split())
    s = input()
    arr = []
    arr.append(x)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i]=='R' :
            x+=1
            arr.append(x)   
        else:
            x-=1
            arr.append(x)   
    print(len(set(arr)))

'''
for lines 5 and 6, You have to take a blank array in which the values which will be updated later on, could be kept.
for lines 7 to 14, a for loop is introduced in which the values at every index in the for loop will be checked.
then if the value of s[i], i.e. the value on i-th index is 'R' increase 
the given X value and append it in the 'arr' array. and Lastly, print the length of set values that occurred in the 'arr' array.
