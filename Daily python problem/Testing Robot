'''
Chef has bought a new robot, which will be used for delivering dishes to his customers. He started testing 
the robot by letting it move on a line.
Initially, the robot is placed at the coordinate 
x=X. Then, it should execute a sequence of 
N commands, described by a string 
S with length 
N. Each character of this string is either 'L' or 'R', denoting that the robot should walk one step to the left
(decreasing x by 1 ) or to the right (increasing x by 1), respectively.
How many distinct points are visited by the robot when it has executed all the commands? A point 
p is visited by the robot if p is an integer and the robot's position before or after executing some command is x=p.

# cook your dish here

def robot(n,x):
    string = list(input())
    new = [x]
    for i in string:
        if i == "R":
            new.append(new[-1] + 1)
        else:
            new.append(new[-1] - 1)
            
    return (len(set(new)))
   
m=int(input())
for i in range(m):
    n,x=map(int,input().split())
    print(robot(n,x))
