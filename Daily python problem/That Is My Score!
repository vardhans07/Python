Your total score is the sum of your best scores for all scorable problems. That is, for each scorable problem, you look at the scores of all submissions you made on that problem and take the maximum of these scores (or 
0
0 if you didn't make any submissions on that problem); the total score is the sum of the maximum scores you took.

You know the results of all submissions you made. Calculate your total score.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer 
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of 
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer 

N denoting the number of submissions you made.

N lines follow. For each 

i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers 

  and 

 , denoting that your 

i-th submission was on problem 


  and it received a score 

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― your total score.
